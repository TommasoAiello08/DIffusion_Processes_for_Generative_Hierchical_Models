# DIffusion_Processes_for_Generative_Hierchical_Models



This repository accompanies my thesis, which investigates phase transitions in denoising diffusion models applied to hierarchical data generated by formal grammars.

## background

This work investigates on the claim from *a phase transition in diffusion models reveals the hierarchical nature of data*  
by antonio sclocchi, alessandro favero, and matthieu wyart, arguing that the occurrence of a phase transition in the reconstruction of noised inputs is a **general phenomenon across all hierarchical structures generated by machines**, which we **empirically** verify being false.

The repository lives in the controlled setting of **random hierarchy models (rhms)**, where data is synthetically produced by context-free grammars of varying depth and branching. by studying how diffusion models denoise such sequences, we probe the interplay between **hierarchy, noise, and reconstruction accuracy**.

## summary of work

- implemented synthetic corpora using RHMS with both binary and variable-branch grammars.  
- trained transformer-based denoising diffusion models on these datasets.  
- analyzed memorization and generalization regimes under different noise schedules.  
- observed survival–speciation–drift regimes in reconstruction, reproducing theoretical predictions.  
- highlighted how branching topology and sample size govern stability and denoising behavior.
